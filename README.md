# Talky

Talky is a lightweight command-line chat interface that lets you interact with an AI model directly from your terminal. Minimal by design, it’s perfect for quick queries, prototyping, and incorporating AI responses into shell scripts or developer workflows.

## Usage

From the repository root run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Files

- `main.py` — entry point for the CLI chat
- `formater.py` — response formatting utilities
- `timer.py` — simple timing helpers

If you want the description changed to reference a specific model provider, streaming, or conversation history, tell me which details to include and I’ll update it.
